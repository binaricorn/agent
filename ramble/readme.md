Disorganized thoughts about simulations, systems, etc. 

# Challenge of making work that's bigger than yourself

After Francis and I spent a month making the [HOSNY](https://medium.com/dbrs-innovation-labs/humans-of-simulated-new-york-56f73ec1b0b3#.t37fi0g4q) project, "a participative agent-based economic simulation for speculating alternative economies", and decided to open up the simulation tools he made for the project to become a larger toolset and applying to the NEW Inc residency with it, I've come to realize that my inability to explain many parts of our project to be something we can leverage to make the project better.

To understand relationships in the world is to have a stake in it, to have a relationship with it. 

As you can see from my previous work and my perspective and preferred outcomes when I approach the project, I design for small scale interventions. How can I incorporate systems thinking into my work so I can make better things? Help people do the same?

### HOSNY 2.0?
* Douglas Rushkoff writes in [Present Shock: When Everything Happens Now](http://www.rushkoff.com/books/present-shock/) about the Occupy movement:

>The approach is unwieldy and unpredictable but oddly consistent with the values of a postnarrative landscape. The Occupy ethos concerns replacing the zero-sum, closed-ended game of financial competition with a more sustainable, open-ended game of abundance and mutual aid. In the traditional political narrative, this sounds like communism, but to the Occupiers, it is a realization of the peer-to-peer sensibility of the social net. It is not a game that someone wins, but rather a form of play that -- like a massive multiplayer online game -- is successful the more people get to play, and the longer the game is kept going.  

Can the process of using simulations as "speculating alterative worlds" idea, mimic or create the opportunity for better dialogue or conflict resolution? Is a simulation tool a "postnarrative" tool, and is that necessarily a bad thing?

>"In some sense, Thred feels to me like taking The Sims into real life. We are able to quantify your life now to a point that didn't used to exist. The Sims have these quantities about how hungry I am, tired, bored, etc and we simulate their little lives in there. Here you are living your real life and we are actually collecting data about your life and recording it. Right now we just have a few data feeds, but as we get into wearables and all of these other things, we're going to have lots and lots of data about your every single day.

>That initial taste of gaming comes from branching. Wright tells me that people are already playing around with simple versions of pick-your-own-adventure games in Thred, creating branching stories driven by reader choice.

>And then Wright gets a little scary, a little Minority Report about the potential future of this, his latest creation.

>"One of the directions I'm very interested in down the road — and again this is like a platform — is right now we are recording what you do day after day after day," Wright says. "I think once we learn enough about the players, the users, we'll be in a place to possibly start predicting what is going to happen to you next week or two weeks from now and telling stories about that, branching stories."

>I'm confused: "So tell your future story?"

>"Yeah, well, in a branching format, these are branches your life could take," Wright says. "In some sense, you have a branching tree of things you might be doing today, tomorrow, next week, and you can turn that into exploration. There can be a leaf in that tree that you can choose to find.

>"The stream I'm describing right now is created by looking at your data,  your behavior, what we've seen you do, and using that to, in some sense, create a sim of you. This is who we think you are, what you're interested in, what you might do. Now running that sim forward, and seeing what they do.

* [Accelerationist Art | Rob Myers on Furtherfield](http://www.furtherfield.org/features/articles/accelerationist-art "Accelerationist Art | Rob Myers on Furtherfield") 

>Accelerationism is a progressive attitude towards the liberation of reason and production - and therefore selectively technology - rather than the fetishisation of them. The "real" accelerationists in these senses aren't working at Google, although they might in time exploit technology developed there. Chile's early 1970s Cybersyn project provides an informative precedent. It sought to accelerate transition to a socialist economy using limited and almost obsolete mainframe and teleprinter technology. Its Accelerationism lay in the attempt to rationally analyse and spur growth in industry to increase the rate at which it developed, not in technofetishism.

> In the first part of this workshop we will examine the needs of the community in relation to what the museum has to offer. Then in the second half we will examine different ways in which cultural institutions, like the Brooklyn Museum, have supported their communities. You are also invited to bring your ideas and think critically about the possibilities of creating a museum for the people.

#### Are jobs necessary?

* Douglas Rushkoff in Throwing Rocks at the Google Bus:

> In 2008, Utah instituted a four-day working week for public employees by offering them the opportunity to shift from five 8-hour days to four 10-hour days. Fifty percent of the 18,000 people who participated reported that they were more productive, while a full 80 percent asked to maintain the new schedule after the experiment was over, citing benefits to their relationships, families, and general well-being. The reduction in overtime payments and absenteeism saved the state $4 million and reduced carbon emissions by 400,000 metric tons that year.

Counter to that however, is evidence that emerged in 2011 when the state of Utah decided to end its "4/10" workweek when an audit showed an overestimation in savings. This example from Rushkoff failed to acknowledge the immediate consequences of the workweek reduction: almost a third of Utah residents wished public services were open and accessible Monday to Friday. And then there's the adjustments the public employees have to make once the experiment was over: their transportation and childcare costs may increase by 20% as a result.

#### IDEAS City Detroit

* [Can Artists Do Anything to Help Detroit? | Isaac Kaplan on Artsy](https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-can-artists-actually-do-anything-to-help-detroit)

> If you’re listening to a resident, they may say walking by the buildings every day is a psychological strain. Or they may say those buildings are an opportunity to build an immersive work of art. I shouldn’t speak for them. These two narratives aren’t separate, mutually exclusive, or even necessarily incompatible. Rather, the proximity is what causes friction: differing stories told by officials, residents, and developers, owing to differing perspectives all jostling to exist in the same space.

> As Invincible/ill Weaver and Wes Taylor, two members of the Detroit-based artist and activist collective Complex Movements, told me in an email, they wanted to make sure “we were not perpetuating some of the patterns of cultural erasure, displacement, and outsider and corporate-led ‘development’ under the guise of the ‘creative class’ models the city has been facing.” For the most part, such dangers were avoided thanks to “community diligence and the organizers’ openness.” Still, there’s something of a burden placed on Detroiters, who recognize that if they don’t make the effort to be at the table, they will likely end up on the menu, as one put it.

> On Wednesday afternoon, two days into the exercise, different groups visited specific sites in the city that were loose anchors for the proposals they would later put forward. Then everyone gathered back at Kiefer. The fellows began to process what exactly they were there for. Was five days enough to really understand Detroit? What would these ideas be used for? How do outsiders not insult their hosts? “A lot can come out of this,” said artist and activist Halima Cassells, one of the Detroit mentors there to help guide the groups. “But we have to explore our own bias, our own privilege, our own sense of normal. Question everything.” (In that moment, I remembered that Detroiters were not characters in a story for me to write and then leave. Their thoughts are not a resource to be mined. They are real people with real struggles that will go on long after we’ve all left.)

Recommendations that adress the mechanisms of accountability:

> Acknowledge and uplift the history of this city as Anishinaabe indigenous people’s land; the largest majority Black city in the nation with a long legacy of African Diasporic global contributions; and the specific history of this building and its relevance as a hospital for infectious disease, and as the hall of records for Detroiters- now closed as a symbol of the displacement and erasure of many generations’ history from this city at the beginning of the conference. 

> Agree to hold conversation about the trend of community member criminalization, state violence, security and policing plans as related to this conference and this development as it proceeds; prioritizing security strategies that proactively de-escalate rather than perpetuate state and private “security” violence.

> Within each session: facilitate a process for detailed note-taking with attribution to the authors for ideas generated and make this documentation available to all participants (as a way to create transparency and prevent cooptation of ideas).
Agree to support ongoing conversations between between the city government agencies and private foundations that support IDEAS City and Detroit grassroots organizations, artists, and residents.

> Agree to support Community Benefits Agreement work that leads to a legally binding contract giving community a voice; specifically between the city, local businesses and resident associations surrounding the Herman Kiefer Health Complex, such as West Grand Blvd. Collaborative and others likely to be most impacted by development, with Castellano Studios and any other interested parties.

### ...with every big data set, we need to ask which people are excluded. Which places are less visible? What happens if you live in the shadow of big data sets?
[The following bullet points taken from The Hidden Biases in Big Data | Kate Crawford on Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2013/04/the-hidden-biases-in-big-data)

- *Data fundamentalism*: The notion that correlation always indicates causation, and that massive data sets and predictive analytics always reflect objective truth.

- *Signal problem*: Data are assumed to accurately reflect the social world, but there are significant gaps, with little or no signal coming from particular communities:
> For example, consider the Twitter data generated by Hurricane Sandy, more than 20 million tweets between October 27 and November 1. A fascinating study combining Sandy-related Twitter and Foursquare data produced some expected findings (grocery shopping peaks the night before the storm) and some surprising ones (nightlife picked up the day after — presumably when cabin fever strikes). But these data don’t represent the whole picture. The greatest number of tweets about Sandy came from Manhattan. This makes sense given the city’s high level of smartphone ownership and Twitter use, but it creates the illusion that Manhattan was the hub of the disaster. Very few messages originated from more severely affected locations, such as Breezy Point, Coney Island and Rockaway. As extended power blackouts drained batteries and limited cellular access, even fewer tweets came from the worst hit areas. In fact, there was much more going on outside the privileged, urban experience of Sandy that Twitter data failed to convey, especially in aggregate. 

- We can move from the focus on merely “big” data towards something more three-dimensional: data with depth:
> In the near term, data scientists should take a page from social scientists, who have a long history of asking where the data they’re working with comes from, what methods were used to gather and analyze it, and what cognitive biases they might bring to its interpretation (for more, see “Raw Data is an Oxymoron“). Longer term, we must ask how we can bring together big data approaches with small data studies — computational social science with traditional qualitative methods. We know that data insights can be found at multiple levels of granularity, and by combining methods such as ethnography with analytics, or conducting semi-structured interviews paired with information retrieval techniques, we can add depth to the data we collect. We get a much richer sense of the world when we ask people the why and the how not just the “how many”. This goes beyond merely conducting focus groups to confirm what you already want to see in a big data set. It means complementing data sources with rigorous qualitative research. Social science methodologies may make the challenge of understanding big data more complex, but they also bring context-awareness to our research to address serious signal problems.
