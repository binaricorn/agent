# Example Code

This directory contains example models meant to test and demonstrate Mesa's features, and provide demonstrations for how to build and analyze agent-based models. For more information on each model, see its own Readme and documentation.


### Color Patches
A cellular automaton model where agents opinions are influenced by that of their neighbors. As the model evolves, color patches representing the prevailing opinion in a given area expand, contract, and sometimes disappear.

### ConwaysGameOfLife

Implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life), a cellular automata where simple rules can give rise to complex patterns.

### EpsteinCivilViolence
Joshua Epstein's [model](http://www.uvm.edu/~pdodds/files/papers/others/2002/epstein2002a.pdf) of how a decentralized uprising can be suppressed or reach a critical mass of support.

### Flockers
[Boids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids)-style flocking model, demonstrating the use of agents moving through a continuous space following direction vectors.

### ForestFire
Simple cellular automata of a fire spreading through a forest of cells on a grid, based on the NetLogo [Fire model](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/Fire).

### PD_Grid
Grid-based demographic prisoner's dilemma model, demonstrating how simple mimicing can lead to the emergence of widespread cooperation -- and how a model activation regime can change its outcome.

### Schelling
Mesa implementation of the classic [Schelling segregation model](http://nifty.stanford.edu/2014/mccown-schelling-model-segregation/). 

### Tutorial-Boltzmann_Wealth_Model
Completed code to go along with the [tutorial]() on making a simple model of how a highly-skewed wealth distribution can emerge from simple rules.

### WolfSheep
Implementation of an ecological model of predation and reproduction, based on the NetLogo [Wolf Sheep Predation model](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/WolfSheepPredation).
