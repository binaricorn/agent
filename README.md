### Reading

#### Critical theory
* [Accelerationist Art | Rob Myers on Furtherfield](http://www.furtherfield.org/features/articles/accelerationist-art "Accelerationist Art | Rob Myers on Furtherfield") 

>Accelerationism is a progressive attitude towards the liberation of reason and production - and therefore selectively technology - rather than the fetishisation of them. The "real" accelerationists in these senses aren't working at Google, although they might in time exploit technology developed there. Chile's early 1970s Cybersyn project provides an informative precedent. It sought to accelerate transition to a socialist economy using limited and almost obsolete mainframe and teleprinter technology. Its Accelerationism lay in the attempt to rationally analyse and spur growth in industry to increase the rate at which it developed, not in technofetishism.

* [Two Cultures | C.P. Snow](http://sciencepolicy.colorado.edu/students/envs_5110/snow_1959.pdf "Two Cultures | C.P. Snow")

>The intellectual life of the whole of western society" was split into the titular two cultures — namely the sciences and the humanities — and that this was a major hindrance to solving the world's problems.

* [Paul Virilio | Speed and Politics](https://naturetecture.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/virilio-speed-and-politics.pdf "Paul Virilio | Speed and Politics")

>Dromology is important when considering the structuring of society in relation to warfare and modern media. He notes that the speed at which something happens may change its essential nature, and that which moves with speed quickly comes to dominate that which is slower. 'Whoever controls the territory possesses it. Possession of territory is not primarily about laws and contracts, but first and foremost a matter of movement and circulation.'

What does nihilism and presentism have to do with all this?

### Experiments in planning

#### IDEAS City Detroit

* [Can Artists Do Anything to Help Detroit? | Isaac Kaplan on Artsy](https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-can-artists-actually-do-anything-to-help-detroit)

> If you’re listening to a resident, they may say walking by the buildings every day is a psychological strain. Or they may say those buildings are an opportunity to build an immersive work of art. I shouldn’t speak for them. These two narratives aren’t separate, mutually exclusive, or even necessarily incompatible. Rather, the proximity is what causes friction: differing stories told by officials, residents, and developers, owing to differing perspectives all jostling to exist in the same space.

> As Invincible/ill Weaver and Wes Taylor, two members of the Detroit-based artist and activist collective Complex Movements, told me in an email, they wanted to make sure “we were not perpetuating some of the patterns of cultural erasure, displacement, and outsider and corporate-led ‘development’ under the guise of the ‘creative class’ models the city has been facing.” For the most part, such dangers were avoided thanks to “community diligence and the organizers’ openness.” Still, there’s something of a burden placed on Detroiters, who recognize that if they don’t make the effort to be at the table, they will likely end up on the menu, as one put it.

> On Wednesday afternoon, two days into the exercise, different groups visited specific sites in the city that were loose anchors for the proposals they would later put forward. Then everyone gathered back at Kiefer. The fellows began to process what exactly they were there for. Was five days enough to really understand Detroit? What would these ideas be used for? How do outsiders not insult their hosts? “A lot can come out of this,” said artist and activist Halima Cassells, one of the Detroit mentors there to help guide the groups. “But we have to explore our own bias, our own privilege, our own sense of normal. Question everything.” (In that moment, I remembered that Detroiters were not characters in a story for me to write and then leave. Their thoughts are not a resource to be mined. They are real people with real struggles that will go on long after we’ve all left.)

* [IDEAS City Detroit | New Museum staff and Detroit residents, specifically address the abandoned Herman Kiefer Hospital](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ksfCsNEDgBEaVJzWKgFsdTdpz3BFNxWVb1PVsUOYvAU/edit)

Recommendations that adress the mechanisms of accountability:

> Acknowledge and uplift the history of this city as Anishinaabe indigenous people’s land; the largest majority Black city in the nation with a long legacy of African Diasporic global contributions; and the specific history of this building and its relevance as a hospital for infectious disease, and as the hall of records for Detroiters- now closed as a symbol of the displacement and erasure of many generations’ history from this city at the beginning of the conference. 

> Agree to hold conversation about the trend of community member criminalization, state violence, security and policing plans as related to this conference and this development as it proceeds; prioritizing security strategies that proactively de-escalate rather than perpetuate state and private “security” violence.

> Within each session: facilitate a process for detailed note-taking with attribution to the authors for ideas generated and make this documentation available to all participants (as a way to create transparency and prevent cooptation of ideas).
Agree to support ongoing conversations between between the city government agencies and private foundations that support IDEAS City and Detroit grassroots organizations, artists, and residents.

> Agree to support Community Benefits Agreement work that leads to a legally binding contract giving community a voice; specifically between the city, local businesses and resident associations surrounding the Herman Kiefer Health Complex, such as West Grand Blvd. Collaborative and others likely to be most impacted by development, with Castellano Studios and any other interested parties.
With the goal of addressing local economic challenges and creating positive change through the 5-day conference, IDEAS CITY Detroit has the opportunity to support a more locally based, self-sustaining economy.
