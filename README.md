#### Critical theory
* [Accelerationist Art | Rob Myers on Furtherfield](http://www.furtherfield.org/features/articles/accelerationist-art "Accelerationist Art | Rob Myers on Furtherfield") 

"Accelerationism is a progressive attitude towards the liberation of reason and production - and therefore selectively technology - rather than the fetishisation of them. The "real" accelerationists in these senses aren't working at Google, although they might in time exploit technology developed there. Chile's early 1970s Cybersyn project provides an informative precedent. It sought to accelerate transition to a socialist economy using limited and almost obsolete mainframe and teleprinter technology. Its Accelerationism lay in the attempt to rationally analyse and spur growth in industry to increase the rate at which it developed, not in technofetishism."

* [Two Cultures | C.P. Snow](http://sciencepolicy.colorado.edu/students/envs_5110/snow_1959.pdf "Two Cultures | C.P. Snow")

"The intellectual life of the whole of western society" was split into the titular two cultures — namely the sciences and the humanities — and that this was a major hindrance to solving the world's problems."

* [Paul Virilio | Speed and Politics](https://naturetecture.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/virilio-speed-and-politics.pdf "Paul Virilio | Speed and Politics")

"Dromology is important when considering the structuring of society in relation to warfare and modern media. He notes that the speed at which something happens may change its essential nature, and that which moves with speed quickly comes to dominate that which is slower. 'Whoever controls the territory possesses it. Possession of territory is not primarily about laws and contracts, but first and foremost a matter of movement and circulation.'"

* [Can Artists Do Anything to Help Detroit? | Isaac Kaplan on Artsy](https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-can-artists-actually-do-anything-to-help-detroit)

> If you’re listening to a resident, they may say walking by the buildings every day is a psychological strain. Or they may say those buildings are an opportunity to build an immersive work of art. I shouldn’t speak for them. These two narratives aren’t separate, mutually exclusive, or even necessarily incompatible. Rather, the proximity is what causes friction: differing stories told by officials, residents, and developers, owing to differing perspectives all jostling to exist in the same space.

> As Invincible/ill Weaver and Wes Taylor, two members of the Detroit-based artist and activist collective Complex Movements, told me in an email, they wanted to make sure “we were not perpetuating some of the patterns of cultural erasure, displacement, and outsider and corporate-led ‘development’ under the guise of the ‘creative class’ models the city has been facing.” For the most part, such dangers were avoided thanks to “community diligence and the organizers’ openness.” Still, there’s something of a burden placed on Detroiters, who recognize that if they don’t make the effort to be at the table, they will likely end up on the menu, as one put it.

> On Wednesday afternoon, two days into the exercise, different groups visited specific sites in the city that were loose anchors for the proposals they would later put forward. Then everyone gathered back at Kiefer. The fellows began to process what exactly they were there for. Was five days enough to really understand Detroit? What would these ideas be used for? How do outsiders not insult their hosts? “A lot can come out of this,” said artist and activist Halima Cassells, one of the Detroit mentors there to help guide the groups. “But we have to explore our own bias, our own privilege, our own sense of normal. Question everything.” (In that moment, I remembered that Detroiters were not characters in a story for me to write and then leave. Their thoughts are not a resource to be mined. They are real people with real struggles that will go on long after we’ve all left.)
